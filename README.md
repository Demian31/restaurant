This is a simple website where I learned how to manually use webpack to seperate js-code into modules. 
Each of the three tabs "home", "menu" and "contact" as well as the inital pageload are seperated into its own module. The modules are then combined into a single file using webpack. 
Furthermore, the front-end layout is implemented with tailwind.css.
